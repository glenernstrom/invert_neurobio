## Description

Core principles of neuroscience have been learned from studying the nervous
systems of invertebrates. Invertebrates such as mollusks, arthropods,
nematodes, flatworms, and annelids provide researchers with easily accessible
nervous systems that can be studied at the molecular, cellular, and systems
level. Common animal behaviors such as habituation, sensitization, and
conditioning can be effiently correlated with underlying cellular and
biochemical processes. The study of invertebrates has been invaluable to
learning general neuroscience mechanisms common to all animals. But what are
the differences? Invertebrates have evolved distinct adaptations that enable
their survival and reproductive success in a wide range of ecological niches.
Through lecture, hands on examination, and reading and discussion of paticular
case studies students will 1.) develop invertebrate taxonomic fluency, 2.)
learn seminal neuroscience contributions from the study of invertebrates,
and 3.) recognize how the continued investigation of invertebrate biology can
lead to new insights into how brains work.

## Course objectives

### 

1. Explain at least three significant neurobiological mechanisms revealed
   through the study of invertebrates. 
2. Provide an in depth description of the distinctive neurobiological
   adaptations of at least one invertebrate species or related group of
   species.
3. Name and describe at least three active areas of invertebrate neuroscience
   research, their aims, and any recent discoveries. 
4. Accurately list and identify charactistics of major invertebrate taxa. 
5. Effectively display biological data to inform and inspire a general
   audience.

## Assessments

To accomodate different learning styles a variety of formative and summative
assessments will be used to build and assess learning. 

1. Weekly adaptive online quizzes
2. Summative exams at the end of each unit (approximately every 3 weeks)
3. Practical quizzes
4. Final project: public poster presentation*

* contingent on budget to print 4' x 3' poster x15 *
